Error 1:
implicit declaration of function ‘do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime’
Solution 1:
Define the deprecated call to be ktime_get_ts(ts)
Source:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/309376/do-posix-clock-monotonic-gettime-is-missing-in-linux-time-h
Commit Message 1:
Patched deprecated 'posix_clock' to modern 'ktime'

Error 2:
unknown type name ‘wait_queue_t’
Solution 2:
Update to modern 'entry' naming scheme.
Source:

A pattern of similar errors has surfaced.
Until newer/unencountered/notable errors occur,
we will refer to similar error fixes as Patch '#'.

Error 6:
dereferencing pointer to incomplete type 'struct task_struct'
Solution 6:
According to source[0] below, an incomplete pointer is forward declared
and must know beforehand what memory is needed for the struct in order to compile.
A google query about what header defines 'task_struct' for us leads to source[1],
which is an email exchange stating it is bad practice to directly pull from /asm/uaccess.h
and should instead pull from /linux/uaccess.h for the sake of being architecture agnostic.
source[0] also concludes that this solution is also more user code friendly.
An alternative solution may be to pull from /linux/sched.h, but this may also result in an incomplete pointer.

Commit Message 6:
Patch 7: Replaced Assembly header with architecture agnostic header.

Error 7:
implicit declaration of function ‘copy_to_user’
Solution 7:
Seems to be a similar case with Error 6.
Include an architecture agnostic copy of the uaccess header.
