# realtek-alc888-patched
Linux Sound Drivers for ALC888 from Realtek's Download Site will not compile on modern systems. This is an explicit modernization effort to patch the C++ compilation errors so users of this Sound Device can listen to audio properly on Linux.

This is a placeholder README.md.
Will be revised with markdown or LaTeX based instructions on progress and plans of this driver upfixer.
